# Waterborne Disease & WASH Infrastructure Spatial Analysis (Kenya)

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between waterborne disease prevalence and access to water and sanitation infrastructure in Kenya using spatial analysis methods.

## Research Question
How do variations in water and sanitation infrastructure relate to waterborne disease prevalence across regions, and are there detectable spatial patterns (clustering/hotspots)?

## Data (high level)
- Outcome: waterborne disease prevalence (regional level)
- Predictors: water access and sanitation indicators
- Geography: Kenya administrative regions

## Methods
- Data cleaning and feature preparation
- Exploratory spatial analysis (mapping & descriptive stats)
- Spatial dependence assessment (e.g., Moran’s I)
- Hotspot / clustering exploration
- Spatial regression / SAR modelling approach (thesis-based)

## Key Results (from thesis)
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

## Outputs
See `/figures` for maps and results highlights.  
See `/docs` for the full thesis PDF.

## Tools
- ArcGIS (mapping)
- Python / R / SPSS (analysis; thesis workflow)

## Next Steps
- Integrate remote sensing layers (rainfall, elevation, land cover, flood risk)
- Extend to spatiotemporal modelling
- Validate with out-of-sample regional prediction
